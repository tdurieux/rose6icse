# Reasons why we believe this artifact deserves that badge

## SmartBugs matches the requirements for the badges as follows:

- [X] The artifacts are functional, carefully documented, available, reusable, consistent, complete, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation.
- [X] The artifacts are publicly accessible from an archival repository: https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs  (see also the Github organization link: https://github.com/smartbugs)
  * The repositories already have external watchers and even [external contributions](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild/issues/1).
  * We are building an already functional dashboard to interact with SmartBugs:
    https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-dashboard
- [X] DOI for https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3628700.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3628700)
